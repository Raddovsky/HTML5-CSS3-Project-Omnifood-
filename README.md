# HTML5-CSS3-Project-Omnifood-
Project involving HTML5 CSS3 a little of JavaScript and jQuery

This project was made by me during one of courses from Udemy.com. It is one of the biggest single-page projects I made. It took me over a week to complete the whole course and during that time I reviewed fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS. "Omnifood" project also involved a little of jQuery library and JavaScript language itself.
