# HTML5-CSS3-Project-Omnifood-
Project involving HTML5 CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery

This project was made by me during one of courses from Udemy.com. It is one of the biggest single-page projects I made. It took me over a week to complete the whole course and during that time I reviewed:

- fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3
- implementation and usage of the Grid System
- icons usage and adjustments 
- responsive design and @media queries
- jQuery library usage
- little bit of JavaScript language itself
- many, many more!
